# Social Impact DAO for Developing Nations

This project aims to build a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on supporting social impact initiatives in developing nations. The DAO will empower communities by allowing them to vote on initiatives, fund projects, and track progress.

## Features
- Decentralized governance through voting.
- Smart contract-powered treasury management.
- Community-led proposals and funding decisions.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local device.
2. Use MetaMask to interact with the DAO dApp.
3. Deploy the smart contracts to the Ethereum network (Base or another test network).
